# bactopia-workshop
An introductory workshop to learn about Bactopia and how you might be able to put it to use.

## Workshop Overview

While I'm using GitHub for this, I opted to split this into smaller sections, so we can avoid walls of text.

| Workshop Sections                                            | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Getting Setup](/workshop/01-getting-setup.md)               | Quick get things setup to start the workshop                 |
| [Bactopia Subcommands](/workshop/02-bactopia-subcommands.md) | Learn about helper commands to assist your usage of Bactopia |
| [Bactopia](/workshop/03-bactopia.md)                         | Start using Bactopia to process a few genomes                |
| [Bactopia Tools](/workshop/04-bactopia-tools.md)             | Extend your analysis of genomes using Bactopia Tools         |

## Future Plans

In the future, this will likely be merged into the main [Bactopia Documentation](https://bactopia.github.io/). This will atleast
allow us to take advantage of MkDocs... *plus it'll just look nicer, and easier to navigate*!
